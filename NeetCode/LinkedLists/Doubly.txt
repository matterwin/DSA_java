// Time complexities
Operation       Big-O       Notes
Access          O(n)        
Search          O(n)
Insertion       O(1)        Assuming you have the reference to the node at the desired position
Deletion        O(1)        Assuming you have the reference to the node at the desired position

So compared to arrays, linked lists are less efficient when accessing a random element due to lack of an in-built index.
So while arrays will access in O(1) in all cases, linked lists are limited by O(n) unless you are accessing the head node.
